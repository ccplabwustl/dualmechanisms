These are knitr (R, https://www.r-project.org/) scripts for analyzing behavioral responses from the DMCC tasks, fMRI (NEUROIMAGING) version. If you are new to knitr, see https://yihui.name/knitr/ and http://mvpa.blogspot.com/2014/12/tutorial-knitr-for-neuroimagers.html to get started. 

Most documentation is in the knitr scripts, so please read the comments carefully. To compile the knitr scripts using the example data provided, all that should be required is to change the lines at the top of each script, immediately following the `# **** change these lines` comment. In particular, in.path needs to point to where the `/NEUROIMAGING/exampleDataset/input/` files are located on your local machine.

Hints: while the knitrs for the example dataset are collected into a single directory, each knitr should be compiled in its own directory to avoid mixing images across files. I suggest that you copy the `/analysisCode/` directory structure to your local machine, making a separate copy of the structure for each participant. The subject ID codes can then be inserted into each template file. Only the .rnw and .pdf files need to be saved; the other files will be recreated when the .rnw is recompiled.

As time permits, I will add group analysis versions of this code, as well as code to write out .csv versions of the summary statistics and compile the knitrs for each subject in batches. Please contact me (Jo, jetzel@wustl.edu) with questions, bugs, comments, and feature requests.
